Introduction Scenes:

S1: 1. The sun had long since set over the small town, the dimming glow of a single streetlight across the abandoned
highway the only source of light. The only sounds were the occasional moans of the undead, as they shambled aimlessly
through the deserted town. A once thriving community now reduced to nothing more than a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
The town had been overrun by zombies, their numbers increasing with each passing day.
But there was one man who still roamed the streets, determined to survive against all odds. Joe had been a resident
of the town before the outbreak, but now he was the only living soul left.
Moving cautiously, his footsteps echoing against the concrete. The man knew he had to be careful, as the zombies were
always on the hunt for fresh flesh.
