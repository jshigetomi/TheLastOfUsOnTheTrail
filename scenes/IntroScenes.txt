Introduction Scenes:

S1: The sun had long since set over the small town, the dimming glow of a single streetlight across the abandoned
S1: highway the only source of light. The only sounds were the occasional moans of the undead, as they shambled aimlessly
S1: through the deserted town. A once thriving community now reduced to nothing more than a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
S1: The town had been overrun by zombies, their numbers increasing with each passing day.
S1: But there was one man who still roamed the streets, determined to survive against all odds. Joe had been a resident
S1: of the town before the outbreak, but now he was the only living soul left.
S1: Moving cautiously, his footsteps echoing against the concrete. Joe knew he had to be careful, as the zombies were
S1: always on the hunt for fresh flesh.
